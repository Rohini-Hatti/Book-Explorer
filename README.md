ake-Home Exercise: Book Explorer
Project Overview
The Book Explorer is a React-based web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, view detailed book information, and manage a personal list of favorite books. This exercise tests your skills in modern JavaScript, React fundamentals, state management, routing, form handling, testing, and best practices in accessibility and performance optimization.

Functional Requirements
1. Search Functionality
Feature: Provide a multi-field search form where users can input queries by title, author, or genre/keyword.
Behavior:
On submission, fetch a list of books from the Google Books API based on the provided inputs.
Display search results in a responsive grid or list format.
Display: Each book should show:
Title
Author(s)
Cover image (thumbnail)
Brief description (if available)
2. Book Details
Feature: Allow users to click on a book to view more detailed information.
Implementation:
Use a dedicated details page accessible via a unique URL (e.g., /book/:id).
Optionally, implement a modal overlay as an alternative.
Optimization: Use code-splitting (e.g., React.lazy and Suspense) to lazy load the details view for performance.
3. Favorites Management
Feature: Enable users to add and remove books from a "favorites" list.
State Management: Use a global state solution such as:
Context API
Redux
MobX
Display: Provide a dedicated page (e.g., /favorites) to view all favorite books.
4. Routing and Navigation
Feature: Implement client-side routing using React Router.
Routes:
/: Search page with the search form and results.
/book/:id: Book details page for a specific book.
/favorites: Page displaying the user's favorite books.
Navigation: Include a navigation bar or menu with links to the Search and Favorites pages.
5. Form Handling
Feature: Implement a search form with multiple fields (title, author, genre) and validation.
Behavior:
Ensure at least one field is filled before allowing submission.
Display user-friendly error messages for invalid submissions.
Optional Enhancement: Add a form to allow users to attach notes or tags when adding a book to favorites.
6. User Interface & Experience
Responsiveness: Ensure the application is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Accessibility: Use semantic HTML and include proper ARIA attributes to meet accessibility standards.
Styling: Use CSS (or a CSS-in-JS solution) with attention to maintainability and scalability.
Technical Requirements
1. Modern React & JavaScript
Use functional components and hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect, useMemo) for most of the implementation.
Write clean, modular, and well-documented code using ES6+ features.
2. React Router
Implement routing with at least three routes: /, /book/:id, and /favorites.
Use dynamic routing for the book details page (e.g., /book/:id).
Ensure proper navigation between pages using Link or NavLink.
3. Form Handling
Use controlled components to manage form state.
Implement form validation to ensure at least one search field is filled.
Handle form submissions and integrate with the Google Books API.
4. Optional: TypeScript
You may choose to use TypeScript to add type safety to your application. (This is optional but considered a plus.)
5. Build Tools & Bundlers
Set up the project using a modern build toolchain (e.g., Create React App, Vite, or a custom Webpack/Babel configuration).
Ensure that the project can be built and served locally with clear instructions.
6. Testing
Write unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
Test critical components, including:
Search form (validation and submission)
Routing (navigation between pages)
Favorites functionality (adding/removing books)
Aim for good test coverage to demonstrate a commitment to code quality.
7. Performance Optimization
Implement performance optimizations where applicable:
Use memoization (e.g., useMemo, React.memo) to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Apply code-splitting for lazy loading the book details page.
Document any performance considerations in your README.
8. Version Control & Documentation
Use Git for version control and commit your work in a logical, well-documented manner.
Provide a README.md file that includes:
A brief overview of the project.
Instructions on how to set up, run, and test the application.
An explanation of your approach to routing, form handling, state management, and any trade-offs made.
How to Use the Google Books API
Overview
The Google Books API allows you to search for books and retrieve their details. In this project, it will be used to power the search functionality by fetching book data based on user queries.

API Endpoint
Base URL: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q={searchQuery}
Usage: Replace {searchQuery} with the user's input. For multi-field searches, construct the query accordingly (e.g., ?q=intitle:JavaScript+inauthor:Smith).
Key Parameters
q: Required search query. Supports advanced search terms like intitle:, inauthor:, etc.
Examples: ?q=react, ?q=intitle:JavaScript+inauthor:John
maxResults: Optional, limits the number of results (default: 10, max: 40).
Example: ?q=javascript&maxResults=20
startIndex: Optional, for pagination (starting index of results).
Example: ?q=javascript&startIndex=10
Response Structure
The API returns a JSON object with a list of book items under the items key. Each item includes:

id: Unique book identifier.
volumeInfo: Book details, including:
title: Book title.
authors: Array of authors.
description: Brief summary (optional).
imageLinks: Object with image URLs (e.g., thumbnail).
Example Response:

{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "xyz789",
      "volumeInfo": {
        "title": "JavaScript Basics",
        "authors": ["John Smith"],
        "description": "An introduction to JavaScript programming.",
        "imageLinks": {
          "thumbnail": "https://books.google.com/books/content?id=xyz789&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
